# About
Snacktify is an app that utilizes Machine Learning technology to help people identify recipes and nutritional content of food by simply using their smartphone camera. 

# Background Story
Indonesia is one of the countries with the most diverse types of food or cuisine in the world. Each region has its own unique cuisine, with more than 5,300 Indonesian dishes originating from various regions. There are various categories of food, ranging from heavy to light, but the one that is most closely associated with Indonesian people is snacks. Given the Indonesian people's love for cuisine, many of them want to make their own snacks not only to save money but also to enjoy the results. However, the lack of knowledge about Indonesian snacks often makes it difficult to identify them. Moreover, sometimes Indonesians pay little attention to the ingredients and nutritional value of the food they consume, especially for those with allergies to certain ingredients. To tackle this problem, we developed an application called Snacktify that utilizes Machine Learning technology to help people identify recipes and nutritional content of food by simply using their smartphone camera.
